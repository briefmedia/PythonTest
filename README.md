# Brief Media Python Assessment

## Challange
Your task is to create a simple Django/Python RESTful API application. Your application should utilize a SQLite database for persistence and contain endpoints to create, read, update, and delete contacts. API response bodies should be in JSON format. There is no need to create a UI. They app will be tested via Postman.

As you build your application consider the data structure for your contact records. What information is important for a contact? How do you create a contact with multiple phone numbers for example?

Bonus points:
Create Swagger API documentation

### What we are looking for
We are attempting to evaluate your proficiency and confidence with Python, data structures, and APIs. Please spend the most time on the portions of the app that will best demonstrate your aptitude for the role for which you are being considered. If time is a constraint, we would rather see a few things done well than many things done to a lower standard.
Please use good programming patterns.
Really, we are just looking for good code.
